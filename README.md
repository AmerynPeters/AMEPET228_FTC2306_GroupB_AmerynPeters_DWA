This repository is for the Dynamic WebApps course and contains all the folders with my submitted code projects. This course is split into two parts: DWA1-DWA16 form part of the first part. This part focuses on structuring Javascript code using documentation, different programming paradigms, abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation. It also required us to learn about the history of JavaScript, as well as programming in general. This provided me with a comprehensive background knowledge of the evolution of the tech industry.
